## ðŸ’» About The Project

<p align="center">
    ExpenseBook makes it easy to create and manage a budget, track and convert expenses, and stay on top of your finances while you trot around the world.
</p>
<p align="center">
    Free currency converter usage - no account sign up required!
</p>


### ðŸ“Œ Budgets

Once a user successfully creates an account or logged in, the user selects "add a budget" for a new trip, gives it a title, adds a budget total, sets the dates, and currencies based on their home country and the country they plan to visit. Once a budget is created, the budget will be displayed on the budget dashboard. The user can click a budget to get to the budget details page, where the user can add expenses and categorize them. The budget dashboard keeps track of all expense totals and remaining budget balance.  For a detailed insight, the user can click on a budget - the details page got all the expenses listed. The remaining budget tracker makes sure the user is always aware of the current budget situation.


Also be sure to make use of the recommendation section. Filter by categories like, activities or restaurants or search recommendations by price.
