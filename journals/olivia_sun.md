Fixing bugs with team.

Got the user authorization work, logged-in user can only see his/her budgets list. Updated the budgets files in routers and queries to resovle the url confliction between account_id and email. Worked with George on the budget create function: only logged-in user can create his own budget. George drove coding.

George figured out token can be got by result.data.access_token and to use a logout button instead of the logout file. George drove coding to integrate our auth code with main project. Working with team to integrate code from all team members. 
Debugged for gitlab conflictions and gitlab "can not log in" issue, team members helped a lot.
