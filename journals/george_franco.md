Today we worked to finish setting up our docker-compose.yaml and dockerfile.dev. We were able to succesfully configure our server and databases in pgadmin. Additionally, we set up FastAPI so that we can begin backend development tomorrow.

Prior to this we also built a diagram in excalidraw outlying the backend of our project. We had previously done this for the front end, but doing so for the backend helped us understand how to organize our models and where ForeignKeys were appropriate.
