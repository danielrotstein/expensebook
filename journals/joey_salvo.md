Today, I worked on:

*Alex, George, Daniel, Olivia, and I worked on making a diagram of how
 our data tables will be modeled out and sorted out the bounded context
 of our app. I created a excalidraw for a visual and the team contributed
 on making the connections of the foreign keys and tables in our database.
 Today we also worked on creating the tables for our data.

Today, I learned that there is a money data type in postgreSQL. That will probably come in handy later on!
