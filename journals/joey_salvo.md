Today:

I started working on building the main homepage for expensebook. For this, we decided to use material UI framework for our app. We were able to import the library and update the dependancies so that we could use some of the templates.

I learned how to npm install material UI and force the install because our version of react is new and Material UI has yet to be updated to support the version that we are using.

Today:

We did group programming while Alex wrote the code for the creating a budget form and listing the budgets. 

I learned that when using an anon function to call a function, you must pass the params thru so that the function will run properly.

Today:

I created and wired up routes in the ghi for our app and created folders to organize the components.

I also learned how to do a forced git push using "git push -f origin main". This was needed because there was some commits that were pushd to main on accident.

Today:

We worked as a group to complete the remaining CRUD views for the app and tested to ensure functionality. 

I learned that doing group programming can help you identify mistakes and mispellings to reduce the amount of errors in code.

Today:

Daniel, Olivia and I did group programming and worked on getting endpoints for the expenses API. While Daniel wrote the code, Olivia and I were helping out to get the code up and running. 

Today, I learned how to look further into docker to debug and also how to migrate from the docker container using python -m migrations up.

Today, I worked on:

*Alex, George, Daniel, Olivia, and I worked on making a diagram of how
 our data tables will be modeled out and sorted out the bounded context
 of our app. I created a excalidraw for a visual and the team contributed
 on making the connections of the foreign keys and tables in our database.
 Today we also worked on creating the tables for our data.

Today, I learned that there is a money data type in postgreSQL. That will probably come in handy later on!
